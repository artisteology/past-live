Females are not sovereign in Pakistan. They are accountable for house chores, and kids bringing up. They can not live alone like Belgians or Americans as solitary females are insecure in Pak. Most are not granted to do jobs except teaching and beauticians. That is how my life in the past live was also very anxious.
